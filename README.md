1. Project Background
Overview
The Bangumi Data Pipeline is an automated data collection and visualization system designed to extract, process, and visualize user collection data from Bangumi (bgm.tv), a popular Chinese anime, manga, and game database platform. This project addresses the need for users to analyze their media consumption patterns and preferences across different categories.


Problem Statement
Bangumi users currently lack:
•	Centralized data storage: User collection data is scattered across the platform
•	Analytical capabilities: Limited built-in tools for analyzing viewing habits and preferences
•	Visualization options: No easy way to visualize collection statistics and trends
•	Data portability: Difficulty in exporting and using collection data in other applications


Solution
This pipeline provides:
1.	Automated data collection from Bangumi API
2.	Structured storage in MySQL database
3.	Advanced analytics capabilities
4.	Visualization through Notion integration
5.	Incremental updates for efficient data synchronization
